Add the parent comment to comments in the WP Admin area, in order to assist with comment moderation

== Description ==
When moderating comments in the WordPress Admin area, it is useful to be able to see the parent comment if one exists.

= How To Use It =
You don't need to do anything. Simply activate it and the parent comment will appear for comments that have one. 

= Compatibility =
* This plugin requires WordPress 4.2 or above (it probably works on older versions, but I haven't tested it and you really should be on the latest version!).
* I am not currently aware of any compatibility issues with any other WordPress plugins.

= Support =
The free version of this plugin is officially not supported, but if you leave a comment on the plugin's support forum, I'll try to help if I can.

== Changelog ==

= 0.2.1 (11 November 2015) =
* Bug Fix: Made changes to how the comment object is accessed so it works with WordPress 4.4 (plugin breaks with the beta version).

= 0.2 (22 September 2015) =
* Enhancement: Reworked the UI so that the parent comment appears before the comment, in a style similar to a blockquote (props to Jason Lemieux from Postmatic).

= 0.1.1 (19 September 2015) =
* Bug fix: Prevented the plugin from firing during Ajax requests, as we don't want the parent comment added then (for example when user edits their comment on the front end via Ajax).
* Enhancement: Simplified the introduction to the parent comment, removing author name and edit link.
* Enhancement: Tweaked the background colour of the parent comment.
* Enhancement: Slightly increased the size of the Show More link.

= 0.1 (8 September 2015) =
* Initial Beta Release.
